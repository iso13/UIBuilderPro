Feature: Update Network Protocols
As a Network Engineer
I need to update the network protocols
So hackers cannot hack the system

Background:
  Given I am logged in as a Network Engineer
  And I have necessary permissions to update network protocols

Scenario: Ensure outdated protocols are identified
  When the system scans for outdated network protocols
  Then all outdated protocols are identified
  And a report is generated listing these protocols

Scenario: Update protocols to the latest version
  When I initiate the update for identified outdated protocols
  Then the protocols are updated to the latest secure version
  And the system confirms the successful update

Scenario: Verify system security post-update
  When a security audit is conducted after protocol updates
  Then the system should show no vulnerabilities related to network protocols
  And the audit report should confirm enhanced security measures
